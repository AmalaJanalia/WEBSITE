                having Class iQON, an advanced yarn fault detection and
                classification instrument. Using a combination of Visible Light
                and Infrared technology, the machine detects fibre mass
                variations, splice faults and foreign fibre contamination,
                including white polypropylene. Both cleared and uncleared yarn
                are tested regularly to identify the faults and based on the
                test results the process parameters and clearer settings are
                optimised to get the best quality. Loyal uses a combination of
                cottons from Egypt, USA, Israel and India to produce yarns for
                different customer specifications. 100% of both knit and woven
                cloths grey, as well as dyed are inspected before packing.
